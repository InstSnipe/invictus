Current Fuel Plans:
    3-4 fuel types with two varients of each, one high one low
    Plan to chain recipes together to make higher fuels using previous fuels
    Each "Tier" of fuel will be geared towards diffrent things(will be restructured to fit amount of fuels);
        Tier 1, basic, used for your most basic reactors, useful for reactors in outpost and smallest nuclear powered vessels. Perk, slowest burn time

        Tier 2, more intermidit, used for larger of more efficent reactors, useful for small supply depots/bases and mid sized nuclear vessels, ex. adverage nuclear sub most likely will run on this. 

        Tier 3, Advanced, higly efficent, but comes at a faster burn time, useful for HQ's and Large vessles, ex. supercarrier

Current Fuel Refinement Plans:
    Refinement Proccess
        1: SHIT-TON of uranium gathered
        2: Put uranium in mixer with other undecided items/fluids
        3: get like 3 nuggets spicy uranium, 6 nuggets no spicy air uranium (no spicy uranium could be used for CBC and other shells (CBC:MW when?))
        4: mix spicy uranium nuggets with other tbd items/fluids 
        5: get fuel grade uranium(alternative may give weapons grade)
        6: Put spicy fuel in reactor
        7: Wait
        8: Get used fuel
        9: Breakdown used fuel
        10: Repeat 1-9 using products from used fuel to make next fuel
    probably crush ingots into nuggets of U-235 and U-238
    make nuggets into chunks of same isotope
    remix the nuggets and/or chunks into fuels with a proccess of mixers
    (maybe) mix imcomplete fuel with a catalyst of some sort to help diffrenceate the fuel recipes
    some sort of seqienced assembly to finish fuel (probaly just a "compaction" or press)
