Current Fuel Plans:
    3-4 fuel types with two varients of each, one high one low
    Plan to chain recipes together to make higher fuels using previous fuels
    Each "Tier" of fuel will be geared towards diffrent things(will be restructured to fit amount of fuels);
        Tier 1, basic, used for your most basic reactors, useful for reactors in outpost and smallest nuclear powered vessels. Perk, slowest burn time

        Tier 2, more intermidit, used for larger of more efficent reactors, useful for small supply depots/bases and mid sized nuclear vessels, ex. adverage nuclear sub most likely will run on this. 

        Tier 3, Advanced, higly efficent, but comes at a faster burn time, useful for HQ's and Large vessles, ex. supercarrier
